# Super Simple Stretch API

This is a super simple Python API for interacting with the Stretch robot.

## Getting Started

Install the API on the robot using the following command:

```bash
pip install super-simple-stretch-api
```

## References

This is largely a stripped-down and cleaned-up version of the reference Stretch API over [here](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body).

## Developing

I found it helpful to use [deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys) when developing on different Stretch devices.
